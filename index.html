						<h2>Here's an overview of our project.</h2>
						<p align = "justify">One of the effects of climate change and global warming is a change in tourism patterns. 
							For example, <a href =" https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/europes-sweltering-summer-could-send-tourists-cooler-climes-2023-07-18/">
							rising temperatures in Southern Europe could prompt tourists to choose cooler destinations or shift their vacation 
							to spring or autumn instead of summer</a>.  A study entitled <a href = "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/19/14138">
							“High Temperatures and Tourism: Findings from China”</a> also supports the idea. High temperature influences travel patterns, 
							making tourists more inclined to seek relief from the heat. The same can be observed locally. Baguio is one of the popular 
							tourist destinations as it offers a cooler temperature compared to the rest of the country.

								<h3>Average Plots</h3>
								<p align="justify">By plotting both the average monthly temperature and the monthly number of tourists 
									in Baguio, the seasonality in both variables becomes more apparent. However, there 
									appears to be no consistent relationship between them which is further supported by 
									the correlation matrix on the right. At times, tourist peaks align with the lowest 
									temperatures, while at other times, they coincide with the highest temperatures. 
									A possible interpretation of this is that the number of tourists in Baguio is high 
									during the summer when the temperature is at its highest.</p>

								<h3>Correlation Matrix</h3>
								<p align= "justify">Given the correlation matrix, there is a correlation of -0.09 between the temperature 
									and the number of tourists in Baguio. This value denotes a very weak negative 
									correlation.</p>
							</article>
						</div>

						Thus, as verified by our <a href="#exploration">hypothesis testing</a>, there is no correlation

								<h3>Temperature Plot</h3>
								<p align="justify">As seen in the plot, the average monthly temperature in Baguio exhibits 
									seasonality, with the yearly minimum during the start/end of the year and the yearly 
									maximum around the second quarter of the year. This is expected as it is the hottest 
									during the summer season and the coldest around December. </p>

								<h3>Number of Tourists Plot</h3>
								<p align= "justify">As seen in the plot, the number of tourists exhibits seasonality, 
									with it peaking during the start of the second quarter (summer) and towards the 
									end of the year (“Ber-months”). Furthermore, there was also a steady increase 
									in the number of tourists each year up until the decline in 2020 due to the 
									pandemic. The number however is steadily rising after 2021, exhibiting a 
									recovery from the pandemic decline.</p>

					<header>
						<h2>What do these results say?</h2>
						<p align="justify">There is no strong correlation between the temperature in Baguio and the number of tourists. 
							However, the number of tourists exhibits seasonality, with it peaking around the end/start 
							of a year. There is also a steady increase in the number of tourists pre/post-pandemic. As for the temperature, there are no significant changes which must be 
							maintained. </p>

						<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<article class="box style2">
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/temperature clipart.png" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Recommendation #1</h3>
								<p align="justify">For further studies, the difference between the temperature in Baguio 
									and other regions in the Philippines can be used instead of the temperature in Baguio 
									itself. Doing so may better encapsulate the phenomenon of people choosing to go to 
									cooler destinations to escape the heat.</p>

						<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<article class="box style2">
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/conservation.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Recommendation #2</h3>
								<p align="justify">Given the steady increase of tourists in Baguio, it is important that its 
									local government ensures the protection of the environment amidst the growth 
									in tourism through effective policies. An example is conducting rehabilitation 
									projects during non-peak seasons. After all, good environmental conditions are 
									beneficial in attracting tourists. </p>
